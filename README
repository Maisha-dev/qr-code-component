## My process

First i created my html components and i began to style it from top to bottom. i kept on styling till i get a similar result with the design provided.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project helped me to practice what i have learnt so far in html and css. It is an opportunity for me to reflect and research thing i don't understand. I also learnt a new topic like adding box shadow to the card.

```html
<div class="card">
  <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" />
  <p class="intro">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</p>
  <p class="content">
    Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the
    next level
  </p>
</div>
```

```css
.card {
  background-color: hsl(0, 19%, 93%);
  width: 240px;
  height: 380px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  display: flex;

  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

### Continued development

I still want to focus on the use of shadow, since this is my first practice of it. I also want to understand better on using margin and padding, and also css flexbox

### Useful resources

- [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - This helped me when i wanted align the card.My align items was not working, and it was because i didn't give my container a height. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [google](https://www.google.com) - I used it to learn how to add shadow to the card, since this the first time i am working with shadow. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
